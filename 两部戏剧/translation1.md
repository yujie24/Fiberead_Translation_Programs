##试译内容

> The action takes place at the Bank,

这个故事发生在银行

> [The private office of the Chairman of Directors. On the left is a door, leading into the public department. There are two desks. The furniture aims at a deliberately luxurious effect, with armchairs covered in velvet, flowers, statues, carpets, and a telephone. It is midday. KHIRIN is alone; he wears long felt boots, and is shouting through the door.]



> KHIRIN 



> Send someone to the chemist for 15 copecks’ worth of valerian drops, and tell them to bring some drinking water into the Directors’ office! This is the hundredth time I’ve asked! 



> [Goes to a desk] 



> I’m absolutely tired out. This is the fourth day I’ve been working, without a chance of shutting my eyes. From morning to evening I work here, from evening to morning at home. [Coughs] 



> I’ve got an inflammation all over me. I’m hot and cold, and I cough, and my legs ache, and there’s something dancing before my eyes. 



> [Sits] 



> Our scoundrel of a Chairman, the brute, is going to read a report at a general meeting. “Our Bank, its Present and Future.” You’d think he was a Gambetta. 



> [At work] 



> Two, one, one, six, nought, seven, Next, six, nought, one, six. He just wants to throw dust into people’s eyes, and so I sit here and work for him like a galley-slave! This report of his is poetic fiction and nothing more, and here I’ve got to sit day after day and add figures, devil take his soul!  [Rattles on his counting-frame] 



> I can’t stand it! 



> [Writing] 



> That is, one, three, seven, two, one, nought. He promised to reward me for my work. If everything goes well today and the public is properly put into blinkers, he’s promised me a gold charm and 300 roubles bonus. We’ll see. 



> [Works]

> Yes, but if my work all goes for nothing, then you’d better look out. I’m very excitable. If I lose my temper I’m capable of committing some crime, so look out! Yes!
